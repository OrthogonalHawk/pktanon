Project originally forked from the PktAnon project hosted at: http://www.tm.kit.edu/software/pktanon/index.html

The PktAnon software came to my attention several months ago while I was researching anonymization
utilities. It contains a number of great features, especially its run-time configurability. However,
active development seems to have ended by the original creators. I'd like to continue their work
and add some new features; most notably, the ability to read pcap monitor files and anonymize data
at the 802.11 layer. In addition, there are several bugs in the current implementation that a few
good unit tests should help to expose and resolve.
